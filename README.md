**Abstract**
- *Purpose*: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a tyrosine kinase receptor, is defined as an important target in the development of anticancer drugs for non-small cell lung cancer. In the present work, we have performed a graph neural network (GNN) model for rapid anticancer bioactivity prediction.
- *Materials and methods*: ALK inhibitors with IC50 values were taken from the REAXYS database. After preprocessing, all these inhibitors resulted in a dataset of 1664 molecules. Then, a GNN model was built on a training set. The generalization power of the models was assessed by internal and external validation procedures.
- *Results*: The graph neural network model achieved promising results, with an average precision of 0.879 and an F1 score of 0.804 in cross-validation. In external validation, the model achieved an average precision of 0.938 and an F1 score of 0.863.
- *Conclusion*: We can conclude that the forecast model obtained by the graph neural network is suitable for the problem and can be employed to predict the biological activity of new ALK inhibitors.
